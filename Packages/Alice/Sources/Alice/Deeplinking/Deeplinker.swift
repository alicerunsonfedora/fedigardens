//  Deep linking with chica works in two parts:
//
//
//  1. First, the app's URL-scheme is called, followed by a specific set
//     of query items. These query items are sent to `Chica.manage()`, which
//     will then divide the url into tokens.
//
//  2. Secondly, chica will return a `Chica.Deeplinker.Deeplink` according to
//     the type of url received and its associated values.
//

/// The class in charge of all the Deep-linking process.
/// For a detailed explanation of how this works, go to `Deeplinker.swift`
