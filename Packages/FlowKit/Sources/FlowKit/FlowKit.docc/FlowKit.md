# ``FlowKit``

Create apps with a simplified, testable, and concurrency-ready architecture.

## Overview

FlowKit is a framework that provides developers several tools for developing apps with a simplified actor-based
architecture with controlled state. FlowKit works hand in hand with Swift concurrency and SwiftUI to create stateful
flows and views, and it extends XCTest to allow developers to write meaningful and predictable unit tests.
