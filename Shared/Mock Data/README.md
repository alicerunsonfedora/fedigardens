#  Mock Data

The JSON files loaded in this directory are intended to provide mock data when writing views or other files that rely on
test data that matches the Mastodon API.

The data samples have been collected from publicly accessible timelines and pertain to the Gophey account on Mastodon.
No data sample should be using data from another account unless written permission has been granted to do so.
